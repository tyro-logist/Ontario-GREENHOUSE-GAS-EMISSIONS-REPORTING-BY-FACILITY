Just testing the use of GPT3 in for data analysis

GPT3:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a method of analyzing and summarizing data in order to identify patterns, relationships, and trends. For the given data, some possible steps for EDA include:

    Checking for missing values: Look for any missing values in the dataset and decide how to handle them (e.g. imputing, dropping).

    Summarizing the data: Use summary statistics (e.g. mean, median, mode, standard deviation) to get a quick overview of the data.

    Identifying patterns: Look for patterns in the data by creating visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, and bar charts. This can help identify outliers and trends in the data.

    Examining relationships: Investigate the relationships between different variables by creating correlation matrices or scatter plots.

    Identifying key variables: Identify the variables that explain the most variation in the data.

    Identifying outliers: Identify any data points that are significantly different from the rest of the data.

    Identifying trends over time: Group data by year and examine trends in emissions over time.

    Identifying facility wise emissions by grouping data by Facility Owner, Facility Name, and Facility City.

    Identifying emissions by primary NAICS code.

    Identifying total CO2e emissions by summing emissions from all sources in CO2e.
